We removed an missing data for our response variable (bench).
There is no missing data for: Name, Sex, Equipment, Place, MeetCountry, Date.
We are missing data for Age, BodyweightKg, Country and ParentFederation with Age and BodyweightKg being numerical missing 854703 and 10051 observations respectively.
We will firstly look into patterns of missing data for the numerical variables, Age and BodyweightKg.
One thing to address is the lack of results for the category 'Mx' of Sex. Due to the lack of results (49) of the current 2204928, which is 0.002% of the dataset, it makes sense to remove these observations as they will 
massively skew our results given the potential for influence.
