We removed an missing data for our response variable (bench).
There is no missing data for: Name, Sex, Equipment, Place, Tested (binary), Sanctioned, MeetCountry, Date.
We are missing data for Age, BodyweightKg, Country and ParentFederation.
We will firstly look into patterns of missing data for the numerical variables, Age and BodyweightKg.
One thing to address is the lack of results for the category 'Mx' of Sex. Due to the lack of results (88) of the current 2917986, which is 0.003% of the dataset, it makes sense to remove these observations as they will massively skew our results given the potential for influence.
It is clear, America is the leading contributor for missing data both by birth country and meet country. Canada also has a smaller chunk of contribution, and UK and Australia contribute to some of these aspects as well.
